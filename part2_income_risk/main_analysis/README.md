### 3_part2_poisson_main.do
Main file to compute 1) Baseline CV measure 2) CV measure with cluster 

~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_TS_poisson2018.do: Using all sample, exponential specification, produce baseline CV results in the paper

~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_TS_poisson2018_alt2nd.do: Using all sample, exponential specification, but in 2nd step, instead of estimating absolute deviation, estimate CV (absolute deviation divided by predicted conditional mean)

~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_TS_poisson.do: Using sample up to year 2017, exponential specification, check prediction performance (results for Table 1)
~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_inconly_poisson.do: Using sample up to year 2017, only use (functions of) lag income as predictors, compare prediction performance (results for Table 1)
~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_inc_wkdays_poisson.do: Using sample up to year 2017, only use (functions of)  lag income and lag working days as predictors, compare prediction performance (results for Table 1)
~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_inc_wkdays_age_poisson.do: Using sample up to year 2017, only use (functions of) lag income, lag working days, and age as predictors, compare prediction performance (results for Table 1)

~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_dum_poisson_update_new.do: Using sample up to year 2017, exponential specification with updated cluster (likelihood as criteria)
~\CV\Part2_analysis_moment_dum_poisson_update_new2018.do: Using all sample, exponential specification with updated cluster (likelihood as criteria)
