# Processing MCVL data

## Recommended folder structure

The code was written with the following folder structure in mind:
- **do**: contains all the do files that are included in this repository
- **out**: folder that will store the outputs needed for "part1_statistics" and "part2_income_risk"
- **raw**: folder that will house the raw files and "bounds.dta"
- **temp**: folder that will store temporary files produced during the course of processing the data
